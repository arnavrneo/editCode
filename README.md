#### editCode is a code editor which provides you with a beautiful code editing experience by removing all the bloated functionalities. 
#### Why?
I wanted a code editor which would provide a sleek experience. A editor where one can just focus on editing or writing instead of a seeing a lot of functionalities. 
Sometimes one just wants to write, right!

#### How it differs?
editCode is still developing but it isn't supposed to be like famous code editors like VSCode, Sublime Text, Atom and others. editCode is meant for a minimal code editing
experience. Free from all but basic functionalities. It is meant to provide a beautiful experience because coding is beautiful :)

### Features (till now):
- offers syntax-highlighting for 6 languages:
    - Python
    - C
    - Markdown
    - JavaScript
    - HTML
    - CSS
- provides 10 themes
- has a code snippet function which captures the screenshot of the code (right now it captures the whole window but its being resolved)

### Features (I want to add & am working on)
- more themes 
- more language addition
- ability to change background gradients
- resolve the code snippet so as to snap a particular region of code editor
- and other ideas that come in my mind :)

### Executables are also available (experimental). They are wrapped using `nw.js`.
